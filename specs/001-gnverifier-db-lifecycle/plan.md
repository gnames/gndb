# Implementation Plan: GNverifier Database Lifecycle Management

**Branch**: `001-gnverifier-db-lifecycle` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/dimus/code/golang/gndb/specs/001-gnverifier-db-lifecycle/spec.md`


## Summary
Enable users to manage the complete GNverifier database lifecycle locally: create schema, migrate, populate with custom data sources, and optimize for fast name verification. The DatabaseOperator interface provides basic database managerial commands and exposes pgxpool connections; high-level components (SchemaManager, Populator, Optimizer) receive these connections and implement specialized SQL operations internally.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.25
**Primary Dependencies**: pgx/v5 (pgxpool for connection pooling), GORM (AutoMigrate for schema management), cobra (CLI), viper (config), sflib (SFGA data import)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (SFGA format data sources)
**Testing**: go test (unit tests for pure logic, integration tests for io modules)
**Target Platform**: Linux server, macOS CLI
**Project Type**: single (Go CLI application)
**Performance Goals**: 1000 names/sec reconciliation throughput
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, idempotent optimization (rebuild from scratch)
**Scale/Scope**: 100M scientific name-strings, 200M occurrences, 10M vernacular names, 20M occurrences
**User Input**: DatabaseOperator interface must provide pgxpool database connections to high-level lifecycle components

- [X] Documentation is concise and clear

**VIII. Contributor-First Minimalism** *(NON-NEGOTIABLE)*
- [X] Code is simple and explicit, avoids premature abstraction

- [X] Tests are straightforward with clear behavior specifications
- [X] No overly generic abstractions or "framework" patterns

**Structure Decision**: Single Go project structure following constitutional pure/impure separation. DatabaseOperator (pkg/database) defines the interface for basic database operations and connection management. Implementations in internal/io/database provide pgxpool-based connections. High-level lifecycle components (SchemaManager, Populator, Optimizer) receive database connections and execute specialized SQL internally.

## Phase 0 & 1: Research & Design

**Completed Artifacts**:
- `research.md` - Technology decisions (pgxpool, GORM, sflib, CLI structure, logging)
- `data-model.md` - Go struct models for schema generation
- `contracts/*.go` - Interface definitions (DatabaseOperator, SchemaManager, Populator, Optimizer)
- `quickstart.md` - End-to-end CLI usage guide

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Follow TDD workflow strictly (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR):
  1. Contract test tasks (verify interface compliance, must fail initially) [P]
  2. Implementation tasks to make contract tests pass
  3. Integration test tasks (end-to-end lifecycle scenarios)
  4. CLI subcommand tasks (create, migrate, populate, optimize)
  5. Configuration and validation tasks
  6. Documentation updates (CLAUDE.md)

**Key Task Categories**:
1. **DatabaseOperator**:
   - Contract test for Pool() method
   - pgxpool implementation with connection management
   - Integration tests for TableExists, DropAllTables
2. **SchemaManager**:
   - Contract test for Create/Migrate methods
   - GORM AutoMigrate implementation
   - Integration tests with test database
3. **Populator**:
   - Contract test for Populate method
   - sflib integration for SFGA reading
   - pgx CopyFrom for bulk inserts
   - Progress logging
4. **Optimizer**:
   - Contract test for Optimize method
   - Idempotent drop/recreate logic
   - Index and materialized view creation
5. **CLI Subcommands**:
   - create, migrate, populate, optimize commands
   - Configuration loading (viper)
   - Error handling and user prompts

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → implementations → integration tests → CLI
- Dependency order: pkg/config → pkg/database → pkg/lifecycle → internal/io/* → cmd/gndb
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent contracts/tests)

**Estimated Output**: 25-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan



## Status

- [X] Phase 0-1: Research & Design complete
- [X] Phase 2: Task planning approach documented
- [X] Constitution Check: PASS (all principles followed)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command - next step)
