# Tasks: Optimize Database Performance

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/dimus/code/golang/gndb/specs/002-optimize/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase 3.1: Core Implementation
- [ ] T002: Implement the logic to reparse all scientific names and store the resulting data in a fast, low-latency storage.
    - **Note**: This is a high-level task. The implementation details need to be discussed further, following the approach in `gnidump`.
    - This task will likely be broken down into smaller tasks after the discussion.
