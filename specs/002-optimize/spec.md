# Feature Specification: Optimize Database Performance

**Feature Branch**: `002-optimize`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when all names and taxa are imported from data sources database needs to be optimized to be compatible with GNverifier."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack,  APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a database administrator or a user setting up a local `gnverifier` instance, I want to run a command that optimizes the database for performance-critical tasks like name verification, vernacular name detection, and synonym resolution, so that the `gnverifier` application can respond to queries quickly and efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** a fully populated `gnverifier` database, **When** I run the `gndb optimize` command, **Then** the system should apply all necessary database optimizations, such as creating indices, running `VACUUM ANALYZE`, and reporting a success message.
2.  **Given** a database that has not been populated, **When** I run the `gndb optimize` command, **Then** the system should detect that the database is not ready for optimization and return an informative error message.
3.  **Given** an already optimized database, **When** I run the `gndb optimize` command again, **Then** the system should perform the optimization process again from scratch.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the database connection fails or there is insufficient disk space during the optimization process? The system should halt gracefully, report a clear error, and be ready for the user to restart the process from scratch after they have fixed the underlying issue.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a CLI command, `gndb optimize`, to trigger the database optimization process.
- **FR-002**: The `optimize` command MUST verify that the database has been populated with data before proceeding.
- **FR-003**: The optimization process MUST create all necessary indices on the database tables to ensure fast query performance for `gnverifier`.
- **FR-004**: The optimization process MUST execute `VACUUM ANALYZE` on the database to update statistics and improve query planning.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide clear feedback to the user, indicating the start, progress, and completion of the optimization process.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST report any errors that occur during the optimization process with clear, actionable messages.
- **FR-007**: The optimization process MUST be idempotent and restartable, running from the beginning each time it is executed.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Tables**: The optimization process will interact with the existing tables created and populated in previous steps. This includes, but is not limited to, tables for names, vernacular names, and taxonomic data. The primary action is adding indices and optimizing table storage, not changing the schema itself.
