# Quickstart for Optimize Database Performance

This guide provides the steps to use the `optimize` command.

## Prerequisites

-   A `gndb` database must be created and populated with data.

## Running the Optimization

To optimize the database, run the following command:

```bash
gndb optimize
```

This command will apply all the necessary optimizations to the database. The process may take a significant amount of time depending on the size of the database.
