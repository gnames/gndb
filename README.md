## Introduction

GNverifier makes it possible to reconcile/resolve scientific names against
multiple biodiversity data sources with high speed, accuracy. It makes it
possible to find misspellings (via fuzzy matching), filter out 'bad' names,
find out currently acceptable names for taxons, get vernacular/common names.

However GNverifier is a centralized service and might be lacking a particular
data source, or do not have the most recent version of its data. GNdb app
provides means to setup a local GNverifier service and populate it with data
sources that a user needs for research.

However the data sources can be available in many different formats -- Darwin
Core Archives (DwCA), Catalogue of Life Data Package (CoLDP), Excel spread
sheets, simple list of names etc. We developed an intermediate normalization
format Species File Group Archive ([SFGA]) which is simply a SQLite database,
and as such is significantly easier for data handling than text-based
alternatives.

SFGA is an fantastic format that gives you ability to easily query your
biodiversity data. You can use [SF] tool for conversion of popular biodiversity
formats into SFGA and then use the resulting files to populate GNdb.

## Prerequisites

### PostgreSQL

For GNverifier data that usually is kept in `gnames` database.
Find installationg instructions for your operating system.

### SQLite

Not a requirement, but it is very handy for examining SFGA archives.
We recommend to setup [SQLite DB viewer] and [SQLite tools] to make most of
produced SFGA files.
